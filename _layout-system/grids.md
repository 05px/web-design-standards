The grid layout system is a basic grid system used to build site pages where they layout is largely rectangular blocks of content (e.g., homepages and navigation pages). Content in the grid layout is placed with modular **grid items** which live inside **grid boxes**. Grid items require width classes to define what percentage of the screen they should take up. Width classes include:

- `.width-one-half`
- `.width-one-third`
- `.width-two-thirds`
- `.width-one-fourth`
- `.width-three-fourths`
- `.width-one-six`
- `.width-five-sixths`
- `.width-one-twelfth`
- `.width-five-twelfths`  
- `.width-seven-twelfths`
- `.width-eleven-twelfths`
