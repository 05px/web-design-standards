<h3 class="usa-heading">For developers</h3>

<p><strong>HTML</strong> is built with progressive enhancement. All users get critical information and experiences. New browsers get the prettiest experiences, older ones get less pretty, but usable ones. If JavaScript fails, users will still get a robust HTML foundation.</p>

<h4>CSS architecture</h4>

<ol>
  <li>The CSS foundation of this site is built with the <strong>Sass</strong> preprocessor language.</li>
  <li><strong>Bourbon</strong> is used for its simple and lightweight Sass mixin library and <strong>Neat</strong> library is used for the grid framework. Bourbon and Neat are open-source products from <strong>Thoughtbot</strong>.</li>
  <li>The CSS organization and naming conventions follow <strong><a href="https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/css-coding-styleguide/">18F CSS Coding Styleguide</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>CSS selectors are <strong>prefixed</strong> with `<code>usa</code>` (For example: `<code>.usa-button</code>`).</li>
  <li>Uses a <strong>modified BEM</strong> approach created by 18F for <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/css-coding-styleguide/naming/">naming CSS selectors</a>. Objects in CSS are separated by single dashes, multi-word objects are separated by an underscore  (For example: `<code>.usa-button-cool_feature-active</code>`).</li>
  <li>Uses <strong>modular CSS</strong> for scalable, modular, flexible code.</li>
  <li>Uses <strong>nesting</strong> when appropriate. Nest minimally and up to two levels of nesting.</li>
  <li><strong>Global variables</strong> are defined in the _variables.scss file. This is where custom theming can be done to change site-wide colors, fonts, etc.</li>
  <li>Hard coded magic numbers are avoided and, if necessary, defined in the <code>_variables.scss</code> file.</li>
  <li>Media queries are built <strong>mobile first</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Spacing units</strong> are as much as possible defined as rem or em units so they scale appropriately with text size. Pixels can be used for detail work and should not exceed 5px (For example: 3px borders).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Where things are:</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>HTML</strong> markup for the components are located in: <code>_visual, _layout-system,  _elements, _components</code> in the site root.</li>
  <li><strong>Sass</strong> styles are located in: <code>assets/_scss (/core, /elements, /components)</code>. <strong>Compiled CSS</strong> is found in: <code>_site/assets/css/styleguide.css</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>JS</strong> is located in: <code>assets/_js/components.js</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fonts</strong> are located in: <code>assets/fonts</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Images</strong> and icons are located in: <code>assets/img</code>.</li>
</ol>
